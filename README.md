# üíé Diamonds Characteristics Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of diamonds to uncover insights about their characteristics and pricing. Utilizing R, the analysis aims to understand how various attributes influence diamond prices, providing valuable information for both consumers and sellers.

## üìä Dataset

The analysis is based on the `diamonds.csv` dataset, which includes the following features for each diamond:

- **Carat**: Weight of the diamond.
- **Cut**: Quality of the cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- **Color**: Diamond color, from D (best) to J (worst).
- **Clarity**: A measurement of how clear the diamond is.
- **Depth**: Total depth percentage.
- **Table**: Width of the top of the diamond relative to the widest point.
- **Price**: Price in US dollars.
- **X**: Length in mm.
- **Y**: Width in mm.
- **Z**: Depth in mm.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `project_diamonds.Rmd`: R Markdown file containing the full analysis, including code, visualizations, and interpretations.
- `project_diamonds_script.R`: R script with the code used in the analysis.
- `diamonds.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: `dplyr`, `tidyr`
  - Data Visualization: `ggplot2`, `plotly`
  - Others: `readr`, `knitr`, `rmarkdown`

## üîç Analysis Overview

The analysis covers:

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and correcting data types.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key statistics for each feature.
- **Visualization**: Creating plots to visualize distributions and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between variables.
- **Price Prediction**: Exploring how different attributes affect diamond pricing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R installed on your system.
- RStudio (optional but recommended).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dcavaleiro/diamonds.git
   cd diamonds

## üìà Results and conclusions
It was discovered, that around all the features that the dataset had, the carat is the one which has a stronger impact on the diamonds price. Showing, that the heavy the weight the more expensive the gemstone.

Additionally, something interesting that was found, was that out of the 3 dimensions the X dimension meaning the length, is the one that has a stronger influence on the cost. Continuing, it was discovered that colors indeed matter, as there is a negative estimate between colors and price. In other words, the stronger the color the lower the price. This is also presented with the clarity as the purer the precious mineral, meaning the stronger the clarity the higher the price. In conclusion, any customer that wants to buy a new diomond please be aware of this factors as this will decide the value of the diamond you want to buy.
